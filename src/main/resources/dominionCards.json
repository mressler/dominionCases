Normally nothing will prevent you from returning Madman to the Madman pile, but you may fail to due to playing Madman twice via cards like Throne Room. So, for example, if you Procession a Madman, you will get +2 Actions, return Madman to the Madman pile, draw a card per card in your hand, get another +2 Actions, fail to return Madman and so not draw cards the second time, fail to trash Madman, and then gain an Action card costing exactly <1> if you can."
